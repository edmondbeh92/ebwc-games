                Hello there! EBWC Games is maintained by me, a one man hobbyist game developer.
                I like arcade style shooter such as shmups and top-down shooters. I also like games that
                focus on exploration and satisfying rewards, including Metroidvania.

                <br /> <br />

                I had tried making a 2D vertical shmup called <strong className='text-light'>Celestial Raid</strong>.
                Feel free to play it and feedback are very welcomed! I am also currently taking my time to make a 3D top-down shooter and
                learning 3D modelling at the same time, thus you can see some of my test models.

                <br /> <br />

                Thank you for visiting here!
